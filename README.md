# ActionBar Buddy for ElvUI (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do you wish you could make your ElvUI actionbars all appear on mouse over for the ones that have Inherit Global Fade enabled but not display because of other conditions?**  

### With this plugin, you are now able to do so. Pretty lightweight and lets you decide which conditions it will trigger to show the bars (that have inherit global fade option enabled).  With all the triggers disabled, it will allow only mouse over as the trigger to display your bars.
