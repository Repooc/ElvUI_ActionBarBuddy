v2.0 9/15/2024

WARNING: The addon has been overhauled. The settings were reset due to all the changes that have been done
• ActionBar Buddy no longers uses ElvUI's Inherit Global Fade option in the bar's section in the main ElvUI's settings. It now has it's own option in the Bar Settings section in ActionBar Buddy's settings.',
• ActionBar Buddy no longers uses ElvUI's Global Fade Transparency slider option in the General section ElvUI's ActionBars section to determine the value. It can be found in the Global section in ActionBar Buddy's settings.

**NOTE:** If you would like to get back to the same functionality before the rewrite, all you have to do is;
• Open ElvUI Options
• Navigate to: Repooc Reforged Plugins -> ActionBar Buddy -> Bar Settings
• Go to each bar and enable ActionBar Buddy's Inherit Global Fade option as ElvUI's is no longer used when you enable this one.
• While you are doing the step above, ensure Custom Triggers is disabled. Doing so will ensure the triggers on the Global tab will control the bars visibility, just like it was before the rewrite.
• After you have enabled Inherit Global Fade on the bars that had it before and made sure Custom Triggers are disabled, go to the Global tab and adjust the triggers and Global Fade Transparency slider.
• Congratulation's, you now reproduced the same effects as before the rewrite! You should take some time with the Custom Triggers on some bars as it can yield some nice and clean looking UI!
